# tic-tac-toe-python
A simple Tic Tac Toe game made in Python for learning purposes.
## Notes
The script/program is currently at it's 1.0 version. The code could probaly be cleaner and changed to not rely so much (or at all) at changing global variables all the time, but it works well for now. If I ever feel like changing it, a new version will be made available.
## Dependencies
Python 3.x
## Installation
Simply extract the file to the folder of your liking.
## Usage
- Open the terminal
- Change directory with 'cd' to the location of the main file "tic_tac_toe.py"
- Execute the file with the command "python tic_tac_toe.py" or python3 tic_tac_toe.py"
